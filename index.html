    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>My name is Neelima Prasad, and I am a mathematics-computer science major at UCSD.</p>
      
    <p>I am originally from Los Alamos, NM, where I lived for over 18 years. It is a beautiful mountain town, with a very small population.

<p>I am really excited for CSE 110! Some of the skills I am most looking forward to learning/improving upon are</p>
<p>
  - Working in a manner that is similar to industry
      </p>
      <p>
  - Learning how to work collaboratively on a coding project
      </p>
- Understanding how to not only write code, but write code that others can read and understand easily
